# Blockchain-System
Overview
This project implements a basic blockchain system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and fundamental data structure concepts in C++. The blockchain is a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger that stores transactions in a secure and chronological manner. This implementation aims to provide a simplified version of a blockchain system to demonstrate core concepts such as blocks, transactions, hashing, and verification.
# Features
Block Creation: Create blocks to store transactions.
Transaction Verification: Verify the integrity of transactions using cryptographic hashing.
Blockchain Validation: Validate the entire blockchain to ensure its integrity.
# Usage
Add Transactions: Use the provided API endpoints to add transactions to the blockchain.
Verify Transactions: Ensure the integrity of transactions by verifying their hashes.
Validate Blockchain: Validate the entire blockchain to check for any tampering.
Explore Data Structures: Study how linked lists and hashing algorithms are utilized in the implementation.
# Deployment on Postman
Import the provided Postman collection.
Test the API endpoints by sending requests with appropriate data.
Verify transactions, add new transactions, and validate the blockchain.
